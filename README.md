# Ecodistricts-cluster-Analysis

Identify Ecodistrict clusters based on environmental and hydrological conditions that are associated with stream flow in the St. Lawrence River Basin. The analysis is being conducted to find three clusters that will each receive a new water flow gauge in one of their rivers using K-Mean algorithm. The analysis is based on Professor Adams Matthew and his colleagues's research paper.
